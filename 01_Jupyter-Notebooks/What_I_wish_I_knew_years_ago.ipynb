    "* Nowadays, computer time is cheap, but human (i.e. YOUR) time is expensive. Wasting it is like throwing cash down the drain. \n",
    "* 99% = Failure. Code doesn't work until it's 100% correct. Progress is thresholded; all or nothing. Maximize threshold crossing.\n",
    "* Debugging, the process of getting from 99% to 100%, is your rate limiting factor. Good debugging --> cross threshold more --> get the most out of your time.\n",
    "* Modularize your code. Big programs are made up of small, reliable chunks.\n",
    "* Write pseudo-code, make maps, and draw pictures. External storage (i.e. paper) averts memory (i.e. working memory) bottlenecks, and solidifies your understanding.\n",
    "* Write the simplest code possible.\n",
    "* Learn to think like a computer. Codes are instructions. Ask yourself what you're asking the computer to do.\n",
    "* Use a style guide. Even if it’s your own made up style guide, be consistent. Keep a format that makes typos/bugs easy to spot.\n",
    "* Comment your code (following a consistent format).\n",
    "* Error rate is ~proportional to the number of lines of code you write (across languages). Concise code with helpful comments minimizes error rate.\n",
    "* Log your bugs, don’t repeat them. Write down every bug/anything that slows you down.\n",
    "* Now you have a checklist. Like a pilot before takeof, refer to it before running your code.\n",
    "* If something doens't work, consult the checklist instead of messing with your code aimlessly.\n",
    "* Don't waste time re-writing code for a problem you already solved. Put good codes in one place, so you've got good code on tap. This is your toolbox, and your codes are your tools.\n",
    "* Take pride in your toolbox. Keep it clean/organized so you don't waste time looking for the right tool (piece of code).\n",
    "* Coding is like playing with legos. You can build whatever you want. Use your imagination, be creative, be innovative. You have to be free to explore!\n",

    "* Log your bugs, and don’t repeat them. Every time you spend time debugging, write down the issue once you solve it, and make a checklist for yourself like a pilot before takeoff. If something doesn’t work next time, you have a list of most probable candidates to check first.\n",
    "* People type at about the same rate, codes usually run at about the same speed, people often get the right idea at about the same speed. These things often vary on a time scales of mere minutes. Yet, people vary in how fast they implement successful code on a time scales of hours, days, or even weeks. This is because debugging is your rate limiting factor. Get good at debugging, minimize time spent doing I. Solve your problem today, not two weeks from now.\n",
    "* You’re going to have problems that you try and try to solve for days and make no progress, and then something will budge. Given a stretch of time to work on something, this means your progress is binary: you made headway, or you didn’t. These best practices are a starting point for you, but you (the student) need to figure out for yourself how maximize the frequency of making things budge."
